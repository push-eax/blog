Wesley has a couple official roles, but in reality, those are just surface labels. Deep inside, he just wants to be happy and free, but just like seemingly everybody else these days, he is under society's spell to do well in school and obtain a successful career. His long-term goal is to break that spell and truly disregard his own meta-judgment as well as others' judgments to live a free and fulfilling life that will also benefit mankind.

Wesley lives by a few philosophies. 

1. It is the final goal of mankind as a whole to explore and conquer the universe(s). I want to help mankind achieve that goal by ultimately expending the majority of my resources on improving spacefaring technologies.

2. We only have one life, as far as we know it, so it's best to enjoy all that life has to offer, try new things, and never regret anything.

3. Never be afraid to be different and to speak your mind. It's people who are different that do great things. It is more valuable to know you're wrong than to not know anything.
